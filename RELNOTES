Etherboot 5.4.0

PXE is now supported.  You will also need to configure your server to
provide a pxelinux.0 loader file, kernel and initrd images, and a
pxelinux.cfg directory with a appropriate configuration spec files.

See the PXELINUX home page at:

    http://syslinux.zytor.com/pxe.php

for more information. 

There is no longer a default target for make.  You must specify an
argument to make. Help text is now provided to indicate possible make
targets.

It should be possible to compile Etherboot with gcc >= 3.3.3, including
gcc 3.4.x now that a couple of bugs have been tracked down. Please mail
reports of success or failure to the etherboot-users list, together with
the versions of gcc and binutils used.

gcc 2.x is not supported anymore. You need at least gcc 3.x to compile
etherboot due to C99 constructs.

Removed etherboot(-pci)?.* rule because there are too many drivers and
the image will no longer fit in memory. I don't want to choose a subset
of drivers as everybody will have different preferences. So I'm going to
piss off everybody equally by deleting the rule. Use the multiple driver
rule (driver1--driver2--...) and select your own subset of drivers.

In order to create .iso and .liso images you will need to have the
packages mtools-3.9.9 or later, and syslinux-2.08 or later installed on
your system.  These packages are available in various locations and
formats.  .liso images are like .iso but use floppy emulation.  If you
have a very old BIOS and .liso images don't work you may wish to try
adding the -s option of syslinux as a last resort.

EMERGENCYDISKBOOT has been renamed EXIT_IF_NO_OFFER, which describes it
better.

Menuing using DHCP options (mknbi/menu.c) has been removed.

.exe format can be generated by doesn't work so not publicised.
