/** X25519 reduction constant
 *
 * The X25519 field prime is p=2^255-19.  This gives us:
 *
 *               p = 2^255 - 19
 *           2^255 = p + 19
 *           2^255 = 19          (mod p)
 *       k * 2^255 = k * 19      (mod p)
 *
 * We can therefore reduce a value modulo p by taking the high-order
 * bits of the value from bit 255 and above, multiplying by 19, and
 * adding this to the low-order 255 bits of the value.
 *
 * This would be cumbersome to do in practice since it would require
 * partitioning the value at a 255-bit boundary (and hence would
 * require some shifting and masking operations).  However, we can
 * note that:
 *
 *       k * 2^255 = k * 19      (mod p)
 *   k * 2 * 2^255 = k * 2 * 19  (mod p)
 *       k * 2^256 = k * 38      (mod p)
 *
 * We can therefore simplify the reduction to taking the high order
 * bits of the value from bit 256 and above, multiplying by 38, and
 * adding this to the low-order 256 bits of the value.
 *
 * Since 256 will inevitably be a multiple of the big integer element
 * size (typically 32 or 64 bits), this avoids the need to perform any
 * shifting or masking operations.
