# Config for Etherboot/32
#
# Do not delete the tag OptionDescription and /OptionDescription
# It is used to automatically generate the documentation.
#
# @OptionDescription@
#	User interaction options:
#
#	-DASK_BOOT=n
#			Ask "Boot from (N)etwork ... or (Q)uit? " 
#			at startup, timeout after n seconds (0 = no timeout).
#			If unset or negative, don't ask and boot immediately
#			using the default.
#	-DBOOT_FIRST
#	-DBOOT_SECOND
#	-DBOOT_THIRD
#			On timeout or Return key from previous
#			question, selects the order to try to boot from
#			various devices.
#			(alternatives: BOOT_NIC, BOOT_DISK,
#			 BOOT_FLOPPY, BOOT_NOTHING)
#			See etherboot.h for prompt and answer strings.
#			BOOT_DISK and BOOT_FLOPPY work only where a driver
#			exists, e.g. in LinuxBIOS.
#			They have no effect on PCBIOS.
#	-DBOOT_INDEX	The device to boot from 0 == any device.
#			1 == The first nic found.
#			2 == The second nic found
#			...
#			BOOT_INDEX only applies to the BOOT_FIRST.  BOOT_SECOND 
#			and BOOT_THIRD search through all of the boot devices.
#	-DBAR_PROGRESS
#			Use rotating bar instead of sequential dots
#			to indicate an IP packet transmitted.
#
#	Boot order options:
#
#	-DBOOT_CLASS_FIRST
#	-DBOOT_CLASS_SECOND
#	-DBOOT_CLASS_THIRD
#			Select the priority of the boot classes
#			Valid values are:
#				BOOT_NIC
#				BOOT_DISK
#				BOOT_FLOPPY
#	BOOT_DISK and BOOT_FLOPPY work only where a driver exists,
#	e.g. in LinuxBIOS.  They have no effect on PCBIOS.
#
#	Boot autoconfiguration protocol options:
#
#	-DALTERNATE_DHCP_PORTS_1067_1068
#			Use ports 1067 and 1068 for DHCP instead of 67 and 68.
#			As these ports are non-standard, you need to configure
#			your DHCP server to use them. This option gets around
#			existing DHCP servers which cannot be touched, for
#			one reason or another, at the cost of non-standard
#			boot images.
#	-DNO_DHCP_SUPPORT
#			Use BOOTP instead of DHCP.
#	-DRARP_NOT_BOOTP
#			Use RARP instead of BOOTP/DHCP.
#	-DREQUIRE_VCI_ETHERBOOT
#			Require an encapsulated Vendor Class Identifier
#			of "Etherboot" in the DHCP reply
#			Requires DHCP support.
#	-DDHCP_CLIENT_ID=\"Identifier\"
#	-DDHCP_CLIENT_ID_LEN=<Client ID length in octets>
#	-DDHCP_CLIENT_ID_TYPE=<Client ID type>
#			Specify a RFC2132 Client Identifier option, length and type.
#			Requires DHCP support.
#	-DDHCP_USER_CLASS=\"UserClass\"
#	-DDHCP_USER_CLASS_LEN=<User Class length in octets>
# 			Specify a RFC3004 User Class option and length. Use this
#			option to set a UC (or multiple UCs) rather than munge the
#			client Vendor Class ID.
#			Requires DHCP support.
#	-DALLOW_ONLY_ENCAPSULATED
#			Ignore Etherboot-specific options that are not within
#			the Etherboot encapsulated options field.  This option
#			should be enabled unless you have a legacy DHCP server
#			configuration from the bad old days before the use of
#			encapsulated Etherboot options.
#	-DDEFAULT_BOOTFILE=\"default_bootfile_name\"
#			Define a default bootfile for the case where your DHCP
#			server does not provide the information.  Example:
#			  -DDEFAULT_BOOTFILE="tftp:///tftpboot/kernel"
#			If you do not specify this option, then DHCP offers that
#			do not specify bootfiles will be ignored.
#
#	NIC tuning parameters:
#
#	-DALLMULTI
#			Turns on multicast reception in the NICs.
#
#	Boot tuning parameters:
#
#	-DCONGESTED
#			Turns on packet retransmission.	 Use it on a
#			congested network, where the normal operation
#			can't boot the image.
#	-DBACKOFF_LIMIT
#			Sets the maximum RFC951 backoff exponent to n.
#			Do not set this unreasonably low, because on networks
#			with many machines they can saturate the link
#			(the delay corresponding to the exponent is a random
#			time in the range 0..3.5*2^n seconds).	Use 5 for a
#			VERY small network (max. 2 minutes delay), 7 for a
#			medium sized network (max. 7.5 minutes delay) or 10
#			for a really huge network with many clients, frequent
#			congestions (max. 1  hour delay).  On average the
#			delay time will be half the maximum value.  If in
#			doubt about the consequences, use a larger value.
#			Also keep in mind that the number of retransmissions
#			is not changed by this setting, so the default of 20
#			may no longer be appropriate.  You might need to set
#			MAX_ARP_RETRIES, MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES, MAX_TFTP_RETRIES
#			and MAX_RPC_RETRIES to a larger value.
#	-DTIMEOUT=n
#			Use with care!! See above.
#			Sets the base of RFC2131 sleep interval to n.
#			This can be used with -DBACKOFF_LIMIT=0 to get a small
#			and constant (predictable) retry interval for embedded
#			devices. This is to achieve short boot delays if both
#			the DHCP Server and the embedded device will be powered
#			on the same time. Otherwise if the DHCP server is ready
#			the client could sleep the next exponentially timeout,
#			e.g. 70 seconds or more. This is not what you want.
#			n should be a multiple of TICKS_PER_SEC (18).
#
#	Boot device options:
#
#	-DTRY_FLOPPY_FIRST
#			If > 0, tries that many times to read the boot
#			sector from a floppy drive before booting from
#			ROM. If successful, does a local boot.
#			It assumes the floppy is bootable.
#	-DEXIT_IF_NO_OFFER
#			If no IP offer is obtained, exit and
#			let the BIOS continue.
#			The accessibility of the TFTP server has no effect,
#			so configure your DHCP/BOOTP server properly.
#			You should probably reduce MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES
#			to a small number like 3.
#
#	Boot image options:
#
#	-DTAGGED_IMAGE
#			Add tagged image kernel boot support (recommended).
#	-DAOUT_IMAGE
#			Add a.out kernel boot support (generic).
#	-DELF_IMAGE
#			Add generic ELF kernel boot support (recommended).
#	-DEL64F_IMAGE
#			Add generic ELF64 kernel boot support (useful for > 4GB disks).
#	-DWINCE_IMAGE
#			Add the ability to boot WINCE.... now only sis630 OK!
#	-DPXE_IMAGE
#			Add the ability to boot PXE NBPs.  Requires
#			PXE_EXPORT.  Currently not supported on
#			anything other than i386
#	-DFREEBSD_PXEEMU
#			Add the ability to boot PXE images... only FreeBSD supported
#	-DIMAGE_MULTIBOOT
#			Add Multiboot image support (currently only
#			for ELF images).
#			Without this, generic ELF support is selected.
#	-DIMAGE_FREEBSD
#			Add FreeBSD image loading support (requires at least
#			-DAOUT_IMAGE and/or -DELF_IMAGE).
#	-DFREEBSD_KERNEL_ENV
#			Pass in FreeBSD kernel environment
#	-DAOUT_LYNX_KDI
#			Add Lynx a.out KDI support
#	-DMULTICAST_LEVEL1
#			Support for sending multicast packets
#	-DMULTICAST_LEVEL2
#			Support for receiving multicast packets
#	-DDNS_RESOLVER
#			Support for resolving hostnames in bootfile name (experimental)
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
#			If defined, includes TFTP support (recommended).
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_NFS
#			If defined, includes NFS support.
#	-DDEFAULT_PROTO_NFS
#			If defined, makes NFS the default protocol instead
#			of TFTP. Requires DOWNLOAD_PROTO_NFS.
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_SLAM
#			If defined, includes Scalable Local Area Multicast
#			support.
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTM
#			If defined, includes TFTP Multicast mode support.
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTP
#			If defined, includes HTTP support.
#
#	Console options:
#
#	-DCONSOLE_FIRMWARE
#			Set for firmware/BIOS provided (default if nothing else is set).
#			Normally this is shows up on your CRT.
#	-DCONSOLE_SERIAL
#			Set for serial console.
#	-DCONSOLE_DUAL
#			Both of the above
#	-DCONSOLE_DIRECT_VGA
#			Set for direct VGA console (only for x86).
#	-DCOMCONSOLE
#			Set port, e.g. 0x3F8.
#	-DCONSPEED
#			Set speed, e.g. 57600.
#	-DCOMPARM
#			Set Line Control Register value for data bits, stop
#			bits and parity. See a National Semiconditor 8250/
#			16450/16550 data sheet for bit meanings.
#			If undefined, defaults to 0x03 = 8N1.
#	-DCOMPRESERVE
#			Ignore COMSPEED and COMPARAM and instead preserve
#			the com port parameters from the previous user
#			of the com port.  Examples of previous user are a BIOS
#			that implements console redirection, lilo and LinuxBIOS.
#			This makes it trivial to keep the serial port
#			speed setting in sync between multiple users.
#			You set the speed in the first user and the
#			rest follow along.
#
#	Interface export options:
#
#	-DPXE_EXPORT
#			Export a PXE API interface.  This is work in
#			progress.  Note that you won't be able to load
#			PXE NBPs unless you also use -DPXE_IMAGE.
#	-DPXE_STRICT
#			Strict(er) compliance with the PXE
#			specification as published by Intel.  This may
#                       or may not be a good thing depending on your
#			view of the spec...
#	-DPXE_DHCP_STRICT
#			Strict compliance of the DHCP request packets
#			with the PXE specification as published by
#			Intel.  This may or may not be a good thing
#			depending on your view of whether requesting
#			vendor options which don't actually exist is
#			pointless or not. You probably want this
#			option if you intend to use Windows RIS or
#			similar.
#
#	Obscure options you probably don't need to touch:
#
#	-DPOWERSAVE
#			Halt the processor when waiting for keyboard input
#			which saves power while waiting for user interaction.
#			Good for compute clusters and VMware emulation.
#			But may not work for all CPUs.
#	-DBUILD_SERIAL
#			Include an auto-incrementing build number in
#			the Etherboot welcome message.  Useful when
#			developing, to be sure that the file you
#			compiled is the one you're currently testing.
#	-DBUILD_ID
#			Include a build ID string in the Etherboot
#			welcome message.  Useful when developing, if
#			you have multiple builds with different
#			configurations and want to check you're
#			running the one you think you are.  Requires
#			-DBUILD_SERIAL.
#
#	BUS options:
#	
#	-DCONFIG_PCI
#			Include support for devices using the pci bus.
#	-DCONFIG_ISA
#			Include support for devices using isa bus.
#	-DCONFIG_PCMCIA
#			Include support for PCMCIA in general *development*
# @/OptionDescription@

# EXPERIMENTAL! Set DHCP_CLIENT_ID to create a Client Identifier (DHCP
# option 61, see RFC2132 section 9.14) when Etherboot sends the DHCP
# DISCOVER and REQUEST packets.  This ID must UNIQUELY identify each
# client on your local network.  Set DHCP_CLIENT_ID_TYPE to the
# appropriate hardware type as described in RFC2132 / RFC1700; this
# almost certainly means using '1' if the Client ID is an Ethernet MAC
# address and '0' otherwise. Set DHCP_CLIENT_ID_LEN to the length of
# the Client ID in octets (this is not a null terminated C string, do
# NOT add 1 for a terminator and do NOT add an extra 1 for the
# hardware type octet).  Note that to identify your client using the
# normal default MAC address of your NIC, you do NOT need to set this
# option, as the MAC address is automatically used in the
# hwtype/chaddr field; note also that this field only sets the DHCP
# option: it does NOT change the MAC address used by the client.

# EXPERIMENTAL! Set DHCP_USER_CLASS to create a User Class option (see
# RFC3004) when Etherboot sends the DHCP DISCOVER and REQUEST packets.
# This can be used for classification of clients, typically so that a
# DHCP server can send an appropriately tailored reply.  Normally, a
# string identifies a class of to which this client instance belongs
# which is useful in your network, such as a department ('FINANCE' or
# 'MARKETING') or hardware type ('THINCLIENT' or 'KIOSK').  Set
# DHCP_USER_CLASS_LEN to the length of DHCP_USER_CLASS in octets.
# This is NOT a null terminated C string, do NOT add 1 for a
# terminator.  RFC3004 advises how to lay out multiple User Class
# options by using an octet for the length of each string, as in this
